# Capstone Pitch

## 30-Second Elevator Pitch

My capstone project is a parody website of the cryptocurrency industry.

**RugRocket.io** — _“Hop on, we’re going to the moon.”_

Users can create an account and start with **$100 in virtual funds** to invest in cryptocurrency coins or create their own. Each coin has its own page displaying its current value, which changes over time using simplified mechanics.

If a coin’s creator (admin) visits their coin’s page, they will see a special **big red “RUG PULL” button**. Activating this button immediately drops the coin’s value to zero and transfers the coin’s liquidity pool into the creator’s account.

The project is designed as a **parody and educational simulator**, not a realistic financial platform, nor is it 100% accurate.
