      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        RugRocket.io is a parody cryptocurrency simulator created to highlight
        the dark side of the market. Users begin with $100 in virtual funds and
        can either invest in crypto coins or make their own with a $25 deposit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creators of a token are granted an admin panel that grants them coin
        controls, including the Rug Pull button, which will immediately drop a
        coin's value and transfers the liquidity pool value in the creator's
        account wallet.
      </p>
      <h3>DISCLAIMERS</h3>
      <p>
        This simulator is purely made for entertainment and educational purposes
        and is a completely safe environment for users to play with the
        simplified mechanics behind the works of a crypto coin. It does not
        endorse or encourage malicious behavior within the real crypto market.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not implement any features that involve real-life currencies,
        however, tips/gratuities are welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simulator may not be entirely accurate to real-world cryptocurrency
        systems.
